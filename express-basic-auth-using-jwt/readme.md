##Starter template for Basic Authentication using JWT and ExpressJS


#####To get started hit the following commands.
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run dev```

Notes - This starter template is very basic example of authentication using JWT and expressJS, We would suggest. We are not performing any DB operation in this example. We have simply created a dummy users array with required data email, password, name, etc.
